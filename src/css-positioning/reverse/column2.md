# Initial / Inherit

Like the best part of the other css properties, **position** property suports the inheritance & initial values.

## - Initial

Resets the browser default value. Usualy, we can consider this is like setting position to `static` <small>~~*(but this is not compatible with IE)*~~</small>.

## - Inherit

Takes the same value as the first parent that has a value specified for the the position property.
